# IoT-Data-Pipeline-with-Azure-IoT-Hub-and-Raspberry-Pi-Simulator
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to create an IoT data pipeline using Azure services and a Raspberry Pi web simulator to send telemetry data (temperature and humidity). The telemetry data is stored in an Azure Cloud storage account and analyzed using Microsoft Excel with line and area charts. Additionally, a Stream Analytics job is used to fetch the telemetry data in CSV format.

# Features
Azure IoT Hub Setup: Create and configure an IoT Hub in Azure to handle telemetry data.
IoT Device Registration: Register an IoT device and connect it to a Raspberry Pi web simulator.
Cloud Storage Account Creation: Set up an Azure Cloud storage account to store the telemetry data.
Stream Analytics Job: Use a Stream Analytics job to stream and fetch telemetry data in a CSV file format.
Data Visualization: Visualize the collected data using line and area charts in Microsoft Excel.

# Steps Covered
Create an Azure Cloud Account

Set up a free-tier Microsoft Azure account (if not already available).
Create an IoT Hub

Configure an IoT Hub in Azure to handle the telemetry data sent by IoT devices.
Register an IoT Device & Connect to Raspberry Pi Simulator

Register an IoT device in the Azure portal and simulate the telemetry data using a Raspberry Pi web simulator.
[Optional] Register Additional IoT Devices

Add more IoT devices if needed for testing.
Create an Azure Cloud Storage Account

Set up an Azure Cloud storage account to store the incoming telemetry data for further analysis.
Create a Stream Analytics Job

Fetch and process the telemetry data by setting up a Stream Analytics job, outputting the data in CSV format.
Download and Visualize Telemetry Data

Download the telemetry data in CSV format and create visualizations using line and area charts in Microsoft Excel.
[Optional] Run Stream Analytics with New IoT Devices

Test the Stream Analytics job with additional IoT devices for expanded analysis.
